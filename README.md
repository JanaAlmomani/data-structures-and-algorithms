# Challenge Title: Binary Tree and BST Implementation.
## Code Challenge: Class 15: Binary Tree and BST Implementation
## Feature Tasks
Node
-	Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Binary Tree
-	Create a Binary Tree class
-	Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
-	pre order
-	in order
-	post order
-	Each depth first traversal method should return an array of values, ordered appropriately.

Binary Search Tree
-	Create a Binary Search Tree class
-	This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
-	Add
-	Arguments: value
-	Return: nothing
-	Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
-	Contains
-	Argument: value
-	Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
