# Challenge Title: Linked List Implementation
## Code Challenge: Class 05 
## Feature Tasks
This project For add new node in the first of the linkedlist
## Whiteboard Process
![]()

## Approach & Efficiency
## Algorithm :
**In short**

1. __init__(self) initializes an empty linked list by setting the head attribute to None.

2. insert(self, value) inserts a new node with the given value at the beginning of the linked list.

3. includes(self, value) traverses the linked list to check if it contains a node with the given value. If it does, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

4. __repr__(self) and __str__(self) return a string representation of the linked list. __repr__ is a more technical representation that is used when the object is printed or shown, while __str__ is a more user-friendly representation that shows the linked list as a sequence of values.


## Big O :
The time complexity is  O(1) 
 The space complexity is  O(n)
